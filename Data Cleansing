# Data Cleansing

> “Data cleaning is the process of fixing or removing incorrect, corrupted, incorrectly formatted, duplicate, or incomplete data within a dataset. When combining multiple data sources, there are many opportunities for data to be duplicated or mislabeled. If data is incorrect, outcomes and algorithms are unreliable, even though they may look correct. There is no one absolute way to prescribe the exact steps in the data cleaning process because the processes will vary from dataset to dataset. But it is crucial to establish a template for your data cleaning process so you know you are doing it the right way every time.” - **Tableau on data cleansing**

Most of the data that I have gathered on the internet, as well as in my job position are often made by people without database knowledge and purely excel experience. Sometimes these data have mislabeling, in-correct formatting, which will all cause issues while analyzing them using computer systems. Below is an example of a public data cleansing gathered from census.gov
